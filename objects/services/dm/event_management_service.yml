dependencies: [resource_registry, process_dispatcher, pubsub_management, data_acquisition_management]

methods:
  create_event_type:
    docstring: |
      Persists the provided EventType object for the specified Org id. The id string returned is the internal id
      by which EventType will be identified in the data store.

    throws:
      BadRequest: if object passed has _id or _rev attribute

  update_event_type:
    docstring: |
      Updates the provided EventType resource.  Throws NotFound exception if
      an existing version of Event is not found.  Throws Conflict if
      the provided EventType object is not based on the latest persisted
      version of the object.
